`control_target` is a collection of mappings for a
target component or group of components.

When there is a single target component, that would
be used for the `Target Root` parameter.
When there are multiple target components, that would
be a parent that contains all of those components, or
the root (which is a parent of every component).

Mappings use paths that are relative to the root.
That can be used for being able to move/copy targets
without redoing all of the mappings.
